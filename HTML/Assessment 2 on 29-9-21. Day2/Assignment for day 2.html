<p> People also connect to their cultural or ethnic group through food patterns. Food is often used as a means of retaining their cultural identity. People from different cultural backgrounds eat different foods. The areas in which families live and where their ancestors originated influence food like and dislikes. These food preferences result in patterns of food choices within a cultural or regional group.

In religion, food is one of the most important parts of religious ceremonies. The role of food in religious culture is an important part of showing respect among their communities and many of these religions obey the religious commandments, hence food is prepared in different ways. The meaning of food is an exploration of culture through food. What we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it, who’s at the table, and who eats first is a form of communication that is, it has a rich cultural base. Beyond merely nourishing the body, what we eat and with whom we eat can inspire and strengthen the bonds between individuals, communities, and even countries. There is no closer relationship than the one with the family and food plays a large part in defining family roles, rules, and traditions. It helps us to discover attitudes, practices, and rituals surrounding food, it sheds light on our most basic beliefs about ourselves and others. There is a relationship between culture and food. This negotiates our identities, cultures and environments.

<p>Food is seen more than just a means of survival. According to Barthes food is considered to be multidimensional, as something that shapes us, our identities, and our cultures and in the end, our society. Just as different clothes signify different things example the white coat a doctor, the uniform of a police officer or army personnel, food also transmits a meaning. But the meaning varies from culture to culture. Furthermore, food could not be viewed as a trope if it did not signify a meaning of something to begin with, for example: tomato, basil and mozzarella cheese on a pizza signify a taste of Italy. In addition, various food tropes are used in everyday life: Many scholars have analyzed the relationships between food, identity and communication. One of the most common ways we use food is in the construction of our personal identities. But can food operate as a sole factor in the identification of a group or an entire nation? Does food have its place within a broader set of values linked to age, religion, social status, of which some are closely linked to diet, while others have no link to food? Is the position of food flexible, or is it central (or trivial) in the formation of one’s identity?</p>

The meaning of food is an exploration of culture through food. What we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it, who’s at the table, and who eats first is a form of communication that is, it has a rich cultural base. Beyond merely nourishing the body, what we eat and with whom we eat can inspire and strengthen the bonds between individuals, communities, and even countries

Religion and Food is also connected which adds meaning and significance to our lives. Some food beliefs and practices are based on religion. Around the world, Muslims fast during Ramadan, believed to be the month during which the Quran, the Islamic holy book, was given from God to the Prophet Muhammad. During this month, Muslims fast during daylight hours, eating and drinking before dawn and after sunset. Orthodox Jews and some conservative Jews follow dietary laws, popularly referred to as a kosher diet which is part of their Jewish scripture. The dietary laws, which describe the use and preparation of animal foods, are followed for purposes of spiritual health. Many followers of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism are vegetarians, in part, because of a doctrine of non-injury or nonviolence. Abstinence from eating meat in these traditions stems from the desire to avoid harming other living creatures. Despite religious food prescriptions, dietary practices vary widely even among those who practice the same faith. Such variations may be due to branches or denominations of a religious group, national variations, and individuals’ or families’ own degree of orthodoxy or religious adherence. In this we can understand that food conveys religious sentiments of the people, making them unique and having their own identity.

	<p><b>How does clothing represent culture?<b><br>
What we wear is more than just material sewn together to protect us, our clothes are a signifier of our identity and culture. So it’s no surprise that over the centuries, communities have used clothing as a means to communicate status, celebrate important events and show unity among many more things.<br>

<underline>Why is fashion important to culture?</underline>

Throughout the ages fashion has been an important part of society and culture. Fashion is important in society because it has the potential to bring different people together to celebrate their own individuality. The best way to enjoy fashion is to wear what you love and be yourself!
<br>
<i>Why is clothing important?</i>
There are 5 reasons why we wear clothing. Protection: Clothing that provides physical safeguards to the body, preventing harm from climate and environment. Identification: Establishing who someone is or what they do. Modesty: Covering the body according to the code of decency established by society.

<strong>Why was clothing invented?</strong>
Modern humans have leaner bodies, which were much more vulnerable to the cold. As a result, our ancestors were forced to make additional technological advances. “We developed better clothing to compensate, which ultimately gave us the edge when the climate got extremely cold [about] 30,000 years ago,” says Gilligan.

What is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere?

<em>Who created earth God or Jesus?</em>
In ways similar to the way Orthodox Christianity views the preexistence of Christ, the belief is that the Christ that was born on this Earth is same Son of God or the Word who existed before this world. However, He is seen as having been created by God the Father.

<p style="color:red">What is the origin of all life? </p>
Arrhenius suggested that life on Earth arose from “panspermia,” microscopic spores that wafted through space from planet to planet or solar system to solar system by radiation pressure. This idea, of course, avoids rather than solves the problem of the origin of life.

How did bacteria come into existence?
One arose from the consequences of cells accumulating substances from the environment, thus increasing their internal osmotic pressure. This resulted in two nearly simultaneous biological solutions: one (Bacteria) was the development of the external sacculus, i.e. the formation of a stress-bearing exoskeleton.

What came first bacteria or archaea?
As the evolutionary story is usually told, first came the prokaryotes: the archaea and bacteria, which are often envisioned as simple bags of enzymes without an intricate structure.


Can a biologist make synthetic cells?
An artificial cell or minimal cell is an engineered particle that mimics one or many functions of a biological cell. Such a cell is not technically feasible yet, but a variation of an artificial cell has been created in which a completely synthetic genome was introduced to genomically emptied host cells.</p>

 Dance as a culture
	<strike>Öykü Potuoğlu-Cook </strike>raises issues regarding urban vernacular movement (dance`
and quotidian performance) in globalised <del>Turkey</del> at the edge of Europe and deals with
multicultural issues of how difference is embodied and politicised in bodily movement in
the gap between Istanbul’s Islamic and secular cultures.
An investigation of a northern Indian traditional dance, Kathak, in the globalised
world is done by Sarah Morelli. She examines how the traditions of teaching this dance
and the whole philosophy behind it have changed in modern conditions, due to the radical socio-political changes in India as well as due to the transplantation of this dance to
America and its popularisation.
A similar case study of the<small> transplantation </small>of the Caribbean dances and culture to
the British area is done by Sherrill Dodds, although she makes even<small> a step further when</small>
asks a question how the Caribbean migrants in London identify with music and dance
from their Caribbean ‘homeland’. These dance-music practices help them to construct
themselves as distinct from a dominant white culture.
In a similar manner, Maruša Pušnik and Kristina Sicherl investigate the transplantation of the global dance culture, salsa, to the local Slovenian context.
 <br>
 <q><mark> Time waits for </mark>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; none </q> <br> <br>
Their interest lies in
examining salsa dance as a tool of <big>interpersonal communication</big> and as a global commodified
popular culture when exploring the various social functions that salsa can perform in global,
individualised, commercialised and <big>highly competitive</big> contemporary societies.
Yet another interesting perspective of contemporary dance practices is opened
by Georgiana Gore. She examines a new dance genre, flash mob dance, consisting of
a collective dance event organized in public spaces through mobile phone and internet
communication. She argues that such dance practices experience rapid global spread in
consumer capitalism and effectively reconfigure urban spaces and performance sites.

<p>he also had to contend with an even more terrifying fact: she would never again regain her omnipotence. Previously, she only needed to stretch her hand to make the heavens and earth tremble or to express her will and gain obedience. She couldn’t believe that her hands, which had held power over the vast heavens and over all living beings, could be so powerless now.

Wealth? Fame? Honor? Glory? Even if one put all these together, it couldn’t compare to her previous power? The thought of dying such an ignominious death and the worrying knowledge that the things she achieved so far would disappear in vain made Vieira Dune choke.

“Let me go…! Let me live…!” Vieira Dune begged for her life as she dangled in Yeon-woo’s grasp.</p> </pre>
